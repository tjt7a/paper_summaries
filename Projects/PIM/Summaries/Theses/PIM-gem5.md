## Introduction

Processing-in-Memory (PIM) is being investigated to address issues of memory and power wall. Now that 3D-stacking manufacturing and the increased demand for bandwidth and parallelism 

Recent work has placed logic layer into 3D-stacked memories. There is a lack of tools for rapid prototyping that makes it challenging to explore new architectures.
