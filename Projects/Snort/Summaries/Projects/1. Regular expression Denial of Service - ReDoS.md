# Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS

## Concepts and Definitions

- **Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)**: A Denial of Service attack that exploits vulnerabilities in Regular Expression engine implementations where the engine is made to work slowly.

- **Evil Regex**: A Regular Expression is called evil if it can be stuck on a crafted input. This crafted input usually contain groupings with repetitions.

## Introduction

A Regular Expression can be converted into a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), where the Regular Expression engine starts at a start state and makes transitions until the end of the input. The problem with an NFA, is that there can be multiple next states, so the Regular Expression engine may determinize the NFA. In this case the algorithm tries all possible passes until a match is found, or all paths are tried and fail.
