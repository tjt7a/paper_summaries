# Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerabilities: An Introduction

## Concepts and Definitions

- **Algorithmic Complexity (AC)**: exploit server-side algorithm worst-case performance, exhausting server's resources

- **AC Time Attack**: a denial of service attack that exhausts CPU resources

- **AC Space Attack**: a denial of service attack that exhausts RAM or Disk resources

- **Decompression Bomb**: an AC Space attack that leverages the efficiency of modern compression algorithms to cause the target to greatly expand a small payload, causing large memory utilization of the file parser.

- **Regular Expression Denial of Service (REDoS)**: a class of vulnerabilities in regular expression engines.

## Introduction

An Algorithmic Complexity (AC) attack takes advantage of the worst-case performance of algorithms that run on servers, exhausting the servers' resources.

Developers choose algorithms to maximize performance in the general case, because they're easy to use, or because "they're the top answer on StackOverflow". Testing is usually done on the average-case, but worst-case performance is usually never evaluated!

AC attacks differ from traditional DDOS attacks in that DDOS attacks require a significant amount of resources. Botnets of thousands or millions of nodes are used to attack a server. An AC attack can be conducted by one node with a small payload and have a similarly significant impact.

AC attacks are cheaper, but they can also be harder to detect because the attack may not deviate from intended functionality.

## Historical Examples

- Alexander Klink and Julian WÃ¤lde found that many deployed hash-tables were using linked lists for storing hash colisions. They created payloads that intentionally collided and quickly filled these linked-lists.

- Decompression Bombs levarage the efficiency of modern compression algorithms to cause the file parser of a decompression program to rapidly use up a server's memory.

- Regular Expression Denial of Service (REDoS) is a class of attacks on regular expression parsing engines. An example REDoS vulnerability exploits backtracking, where the parser requires processing time exponential in input string length.

    - In 2016 StackExchange went down for half an hour due to one bad regex.

    - In 2019, Cloudflare went down because of one bad regex.

## Solutions to AC Vulnerabiltiies

1. Choose a new algorithm

2. Use input sanitization

3. Implement hard resource limits
